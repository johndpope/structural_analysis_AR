title: "Updated Release Includes Indoor AR Tracking"
---

The newest release of the structural analysis AR app includes improved outdoor tracking, as well as both indoor tracking and "untracked" modes. Outdoor tracking now includes the ability to pause and resume AR tracking, allowing students to manipulate loading conditions in various positions. The outdoor tracking portion of the application requires students to view and interact with the Skywalk structure in real time, while a new untracked mode allows students to utilize the app from a remote location. Instead of tracking the physical Skywalk structure, the application tracks a downloadable or printable image of the Skywalk, further enabling use of the app in classroom settings or campus locations other than ISU. A third "untracked" mode allows users to focus on the structural analysis features of the app only through the manipulation of loads on a pre-set image of the Skywalk structure. 

The new version of the app and the downloadable indoor tracking image are available under our "Downloads" page.

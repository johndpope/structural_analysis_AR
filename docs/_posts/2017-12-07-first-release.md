title: "First Test Release of AR Structures App"
---
Our project addresses augmented reality for structural analysis education. The goal is to evaluate the learning outcome gain of engineering students when using AR-based learning in comparison to traditional learning environments, such as lecturing, problem sessions, etc.  

The augmented reality incorporated into the app will superimpose what a student would normally see with a computer generated model, shown through the lens of an iPad. Augmented reality utilizes computer graphics, rapid video processing, and tracking, in order to combine the physical environment with a computer generated virtual world.

Five structural analysis tasks will be integrated into the app, all relating to structures that students frequently see on the campus of Iowa State University. The first task models the Skywalk between two campus buildings. Using interactive 3D visualization technology, students are able to hold an iPad in front of the Skywalk and adjust loading conditions, all while see the resulting reaction forces and deflection values change in real time. Other tasks in the AR app will show the effects of loads on different types of structures, such as frames and trusses. 

The project incorporates several interface development cycles to optimize the studentâ€™s experience, thus, learning outcome.  Therefore, a series of usability tests will be performed on this first prototype of the AR task(s). Students will interact with the application while answering a series of questions. Feedback pertaining the interface and the task will be used to improve the current implementation, and help to develop templates for further tasks.

A first pre-test with students is scheduled to be utilized in structural analysis classrooms next semester.

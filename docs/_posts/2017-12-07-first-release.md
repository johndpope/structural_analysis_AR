After some preliminary meetings, research, and calculations, our team has released the first test version of the AR Structures App. The overall goal of the app is to enhance beginning civil engineering student's understanding of structural analysis by providing a mobile augmented reality via an iPad, alongside the traditional structural analysis teaching pedagogy. 

The augmented reality incorporated into the app will superimpose what a student would normally see with a computer generated model, shown through the lens of an iPad. Augmented reality utilizes computer graphics, rapid video processing, and tracking, in order to combine the physical environment with a computer generated virtual world.

Five modules are currently planned to be integrated into the app, all relating to structures that students frequently see on the campus of Iowa State. The first module models the Skywalk between Hoover Hall and Howe Hall, two engineering buildings on the west side of campus. Using interactive 3D visualization technology, students are able to hold an iPad in front of the Skywalk and adjust loading conditions, all while see the resulting reaction forces and deflection values change in real time. Other modules in the AR app will show the effects of loads on different types of structures, such as frames and trusses. 

A series of usability tests will be performed on this first test release of the AR module. Students will interact with the app while answering a series of questions. Feedback from the usability testing will help to improve the current module, while providing templates for further modules. 

The first module is expected to be utilized in structural analysis classrooms next semester. The team will focus on building the remaining four modules in the next academic year. 

Updates will be posted bi-weekly on our website - check back for more!
